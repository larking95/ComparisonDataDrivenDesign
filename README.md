# What is this?
In this repo, I want to compare the data-driven controller design methods.
The "data-driven" means that controller can be designed (or tuned) only using time domain data.
The major methods of data-driven approach are VRFT (Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning) and FRIT (Fictios Reference Iterative Tuning).
However, these methods looks complex in the view of users.
Therefore, I show the simple example code in matlab and python to explain how to use data-driven design.

The explanation of each method is available on [my blog](https://qiita.com/larking95/).
But only japanese is available, sorry.
